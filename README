here is sample gallery.you can check this program how it works.

Directory tree:
/
- getgroup.php			the program witch scans directories and image files
- scgallery/
  - scgallery.html		the HTML that imports screenshot gallery
  - scgallery.css		CSS for scgallery.html
  - scgallery.js		main program
  - components.html		screenshot gallery's layout
  - icon/			icon files
    ...
- my_images/			group root folder(any name)
  - my_group/			group directory(any name)
    - _low/			thumbnail folder(folder name should '_low')
    - caption.json		comment file
    - image.jpg			image file
    ...

How to:
place group root directory which includes image files and groups (in the above. "my_images")
if you'd like to give comments(optional), create "caption.json" in group directory
and write your comments like this
{
	"title": "groupã€€no.1",
	"mypc.jpg": ["my PC", "athlonX2 5600+ CPU. is that classic CPU at now?"],
	"smiley_face.jpg": ["smile", "How very beautiful smiley face!"]
}
set group's title to "title" entry.
and add comment-entry in this format
"image_filename": ["title of image", "comment of image"]
as much as necessary.

thumbnail image file is not required but if you would like to prepare it,
put the thumbnail into thumbnail-folder and rename (image.jpg) => (image_low.jpg).
In case that the thumbnail is not available, it will be generated by PHP program.
(permission of thumbnail-folder should be 707 or something)

then, write some javascript codes in main-html
$(function(){
	g_SCG = new ScGallery("../getgroup.php", "my_images", $("body"));
});
(yes, $ is jQuery)
the first argument is the path to "getgroup.php",
second is the path to group root folder from "getgroup.php"
and the last is jQueryObject where you'd like to show.

Note:
this program is still in progress so there are some bugs, constraints like here
- getgroup.php scans directories every time. this should be wasting server resource over than it's needed
- image shows always at 640x480 resolution. larger images is resized
- overlay "resize" buttons are not functional.
- thumbnail images will be loaded simultaneously. this causes browser heavy when the group has many image files.
- there is little error handlings
- thumbnail are "alphabet" sorting only

of course these are will be fixed.
